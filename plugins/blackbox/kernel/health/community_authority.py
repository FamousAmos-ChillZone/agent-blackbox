"""Operator alarms about the COMMUNITY authority (Community Curation C10, plan §11 OBSERVE).

The community graph has its own curators (its own root, its own key manifest,
statements in the community graph itself). An operator needs to know when that
trust layer is not working, and that none of it reduces what already protects
them: these are all INFO except a manifest conflict (SECURITY).

* the trust lookup was cut short (the graph is flooded or the node is busy);
* every community curator key is silent / some keys are;
* the community key manifest is pending, stale, about to expire, or in conflict;
* raising statements are being held by this reader's own daily cap.

Facts in, alarms out: :func:`gather` reads them off the community authority's
view (duck-typed — the kernel imports no feature), :func:`alarms` turns them
into items. ``kernel.health.operator_health`` adds them to the operator's list.
