"""This node's reporting identity — the agent address it speaks for.

THE one resolver of "who is this node" for anything identity-keyed (report
subjects, per-reporter counting, the in-report signature R0 adds). Kernel,
because both the community write path and the hooks need it and neither owns
it. Fails closed: ``None`` means "no identity", never a shared placeholder.

Usage::

    from ..kernel import identity
    reporter = identity.reporter_address(client)   # str | None

    dropping reports and corrupting distinct-reporter counting. Identity-keyed
