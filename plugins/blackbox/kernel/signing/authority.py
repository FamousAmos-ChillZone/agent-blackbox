"""The two trust authorities — who may say what, and in which graph.

An authority is a root key, the curator keys its manifest names, the graph it
speaks in and the CLOSED list of statement kinds it may sign there:

* ``VERIFIED`` — the verified graph's owner. Its manifest and its
  enforcement statements (promotion, revocation, pause, the counted-author
  list) live in the verified graph; its advisory statements live in the
  community graph. It may say everything.
* ``COMMUNITY`` — the community's own curators. Everything it says lives in
  the community graph. It may list and delist counted authors, confirm,
  reject, defer and attest community threats, pause community intake and
  publish notices. It may NEVER promote into the verified graph, revoke a
  verified rule or sign a kill list: the strongest thing it can cause is FLAG.

Readers enforce this table for every statement they parse; curators use it to
route what they publish. Adding a statement kind without deciding its row
fails the table test in ``tests/plugins/test_blackbox_authority.py``.

Pattern: Constant table behind two pure functions (a Strategy table keyed by
authority and graph).

Usage::

    from ..kernel.signing.authority import Authority, allowed_kinds, home_graph
    allowed_kinds(Authority.COMMUNITY, in_verified_graph=False)   # frozenset of CuratorStatement
    home_graph(Authority.COMMUNITY, CuratorStatement.COUNTED_AUTHORS)   # "community"
    home_graph(Authority.COMMUNITY, CuratorStatement.REVOCATION)        # None — may not sign it
