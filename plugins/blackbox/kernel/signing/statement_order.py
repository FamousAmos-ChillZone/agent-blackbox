"""Curator statement types and which statement about a threat is current (Refine R7a).

Curator statements are signed blobs that any node can re-share, so "latest"
can never come from when a row arrived or from the sender's ``publishedAt``
clock (KI-105/109). It comes from the per-threat SEQUENCE number inside the
signed envelope (:mod:`.envelope`):

* per (threat, statement type), the highest sequence wins;
* across types, a TERMINAL statement (revocation, rejection) dominates every
  statement with a lower sequence, so an old promotion replayed after a
  revocation loses (KI-143). A later, higher-sequence promotion (a deliberate
  re-promotion) still wins. At an equal sequence the terminal one wins:
  safety is asymmetric (LES-016).

Each type is also classified as raising or reducing enforcement, which is
what reader policy (R7b) needs: holds, freezes and caps apply only to
statements that RAISE enforcement; reducing ones always get through.

Pattern: Enum (:class:`CuratorStatement`) + Value Object
(:class:`OrderedStatement`) + pure resolution functions.

Usage::

    from ..kernel.signing import statement_order as order
    seen = [order.OrderedStatement("dep:npm:x@1", order.CuratorStatement.PROMOTION, 3),
            order.OrderedStatement("dep:npm:x@1", order.CuratorStatement.REVOCATION, 5)]
    order.current_by_threat(seen)["dep:npm:x@1"].kind   # CuratorStatement.REVOCATION
