"""Which running process is this installation's managed DKG node.

``<dkg_home>/daemon.pid`` is a hint, not the truth. A DKG CLI call made while
the node is already running can auto-spawn a second daemon, which dies on the
busy port and leaves ITS pid in daemon.pid (KI-312; KI-045 is the same
auto-spawn). Anything that acts on the node — the settings check, the
systemd check, restarts, the Node runtime lookup — asks this module instead
of reading the file, so a dead pid never sends a restart behind systemd's
back (the KI-059 shape, seen as KI-306 "did not finish stopping").

Usage::

    pid = managed_daemon_pid(cfg)          # None when no node of ours is running
    for process in managed_daemons(cfg):   # every live daemon process of ours
        ...
