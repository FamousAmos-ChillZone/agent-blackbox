"""This machine's own private graph for the local audit record.

WHY (bench 2026-10-10, DKG 10.0.23): the private working-memory audit record was
written into Umanitek's verified graph, and the node refuses that write
(``400 CONTEXT_GRAPH_NOT_FOUND … Write operations must target an existing context
graph``) — the graph belongs to Umanitek's wallet, the node only subscribes to it.
The failure was swallowed, so the dashboard's Local tab stayed empty on every node.

The record now lives in a graph this node OWNS: ``<agent address>/blackbox-local``,
created once (an existing one answers 409, which is fine) and remembered in
``local_audit_graph.json``. Only working memory is ever written to it — private to
the node, never shared — so nothing in it leaves the machine.

Usage::

    graph = local_audit_graph(client)     # "0x…/blackbox-local", or "" when it cannot be had
