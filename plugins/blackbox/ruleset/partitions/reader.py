"""Verified-graph progress and download totals for status, health and the meter.

Progress (``progress.json``): how many confirmed assets the last refresh covered
and when the node's asset count last grew — :func:`catching_up` drives the faster
refresh pace while the graph is still arriving. :func:`verified_download_totals`
is the one aggregate query behind the dashboard's sync meter.

The per-asset reader and its on-disk row cache that lived here (KI-288) were
replaced by the live lookups (DKG-lookup B6): the small tiers are read by typed
lanes in :mod:`..fetching`, dependency / IOC rules stay in the node's store.
:func:`forget_cached_assets` removes the old cache files.

Usage: ``record_progress(cg_id, PartitionRead(total=n, compiled=n))`` · ``progress(cg_id)``
