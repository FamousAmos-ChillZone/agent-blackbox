"""The process's in-memory ruleset generation, kept in step with the disk cache.

Several processes share one ``ruleset.json`` (the dashboard, each agent's
hooks, ``blackbox sync``); any of them may replace the file. Every reader in
this process asks :class:`RulesetCache` for the newest generation: it serves
memory while the file's stamp is unchanged and reloads from disk when another
process has replaced it.

Pattern: Monitor object — the cached ruleset and the stamp it was loaded at
change together, under ONE lock, so the check ("is my copy current?") and the
reload are a single step. Before this class (audit item G5) the check and the
reload took the lock separately: two threads could both see a stale stamp and
both reload, and a reader holding an older file's contents could overwrite a
generation ``refresh()`` had just stored.

Usage::

    cache = RulesetCache(stamp=lambda: file_mtime_ns(), load=read_cache_file)
    rs = cache.current()      # newest generation, or None when nothing exists
    cache.store(rs)           # after writing rs to disk: install it in memory
    cache.memory_only()       # what memory holds, without touching disk
