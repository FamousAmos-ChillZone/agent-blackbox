"""What a ruleset generation ANSWERS at check time — the live side of :class:`Ruleset`.

Pattern: Mixin. :class:`~..compiler.Ruleset` is a dataclass of compiled rules plus
the verified scope; these methods read ``verified_scope`` and the compiled
``dependency`` / ``ioc`` dicts and ask the node's local store for the rest.
They live here, not in compiler.py, because that file sits at its size alarm and
because asking is a different concern from compiling.

* :meth:`LiveAnswering.dependency_rules` / :meth:`LiveAnswering.ioc_rules` — what
  detection calls: live public rules first, compiled (community) rules fill the gaps.
* :meth:`LiveAnswering.verified_subset` — "which of these identifiers are verified?"
  for the curate queue, the confirmed pool and the shadow metrics.
* :meth:`LiveAnswering.live_browse` — one page of the live tiers for the dashboard.
