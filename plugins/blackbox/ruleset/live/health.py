"""What the live lookups could and could not answer — the record every surface reads.

Lookups run inside the agent's process; `blackbox status` and the dashboard run
in others. So the state lives in one small file in the Blackbox home
(``verified_lookup_state.json``), written only on a transition (ok → degraded,
degraded → ok) or at most once a minute while degraded — never once per tool call.

Why this exists (LES-011): a lookup that could not tell lets the action through
(Blackbox never breaks the host agent) but must never LOOK like protection. With
the fallback index off by default, this file is how "verified protection is
paused" reaches the operator.

Pattern: Global Object — one :data:`HEALTH` recorder per process, like
``community.PULSE``; tests build their own :class:`LookupHealth` on a temp path.
