"""Blast-radius gates and last-good (R14, plan §06 KILL LIST) — pure.

A signed kill list is not applied blindly. Reader-side, per entry:

* a WIDE kill (name- or publisher-wide) needs the ROOT as a third signer;
* a kill on a POPULAR or ALLOWLISTED artifact needs the root AND a 24-hour
  hold counted from the list's signed day;
* a version may add at most :data:`MAX_NEW_DISABLES` disables over the
  previous applied list — more, and the WHOLE list is refused.

Refused entries fall out; a refused list leaves the LAST-GOOD list in force.
Never "disable all", never "enable all": the Mozilla 2019 certificate
expiry disabled every add-on at once, which is the failure this guards.

Usage::

    decision = admit(kill_list, signers=..., root_signers=..., previous=last_good, now=time.time(),
                     is_popular=allowlist_predicate)
    decision.applied        # the entries now in force (or the previous list's when refused)
