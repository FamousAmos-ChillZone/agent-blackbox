"""Graph-wide statistics over the community graph — the dashboard's read model.

Pure functions over VERIFIED reports (:func:`.reader.read_verified_reports`):
how many distinct agents have reported, what each reporting agent contributed
(the "Community graph — connected agents" section), and which threats the most
distinct agents reported. Every count keys on the report's verified SIGNER
(``VerifiedReport.author``), never on the self-described ``g:reporter``
string, which is display-only (LES-014, KI-067/110) — so one node posing as
ten addresses is one agent here, exactly as in the ruleset.

The dashboard owns HTTP, caching and sanitization; strings returned here are
unsanitized community data that the caller escapes.

Usage (through the package)::

    from .. import community
    reports = community.read_verified_reports(client, cfg) or []
    count = community.contributing_agent_count(reports)
    agents = community.community_agents(reports, own_author)
    threats = community.most_reported_threats(reports, limit=50)
