"""One per-author budget over ALL community statements, enforced by readers (Refine R2).

Plan §05 (RATE): a hostile client simply skips its own daily cap, so the cap
that matters is the one every READER applies. It covers every statement type
— reports, disputes, retractions — per author (the verified signer key), per
READER-observed UTC day. The day is when THIS node first saw the statement,
never the sender's clock, which can be backdated to spread a flood over many
"days" (KI-105). Over budget, an author's earliest-seen statements of the day
count and the rest are held back and logged.

Joining late is not punished: everything present at this node's very first
read is a one-time BASELINE, exempt from the per-day budget (it is still
bounded by the per-author threat cap in :mod:`..aggregation`).

:class:`FirstSeenStore` is the persisted memory of when each statement was
first seen ($BLACKBOX_HOME/community_first_seen.json). It is bounded to the
statements present in the latest read and written atomically. Several
processes may share a home: the last writer wins, and a lost update only
re-dates a statement to a later first sighting (accepted, like KI-038).

Pattern: a small stateful class with one lock (the store) + a pure policy
(:class:`AuthorBudget`).

Usage::

    result = AuthorBudget(FirstSeenStore()).admit(statements)    # statements: Iterable[Statement]
    result.admitted, result.held_back, result.first_seen
