"""Pending tombstones — withdrawals whose target this reader has not seen (Refine R2).

A retraction can arrive before (or without) the report it withdraws. Plan §05:
such tombstones are kept only for the target's lifetime + 7 days, in a
BOUNDED per-author buffer, so a storm of retractions for reports that do not
exist can neither grow without limit nor hold memory forever. A retraction
only ever withdraws its own signer's report (:mod:`.retractions`), so the
buffer bounds cost, not who can be silenced.

Usage (from the reader)::

    applicable, pending = tombstones.applicable_withdrawals(retractions, reports, first_seen, now)
