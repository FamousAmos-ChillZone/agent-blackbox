"""What the curator has said, as this node can verify it (Refine R2).

Builds ONE :class:`CuratorView` from root-signed key manifests and curator
statements read from both graphs:

* TRUST — a key manifest counts only when signed by a ROOT this network
  trusts (``kernel.signing.trust_anchors``); which manifest a reader acts on
  is ``community.trust.manifests``. No root = no manifest = no curator
  statement counts.
* PLACEMENT — enforcement-affecting statements (promotion, revocation, pause,
  the counted-author list) count only from the VERIFIED graph;
  advisory ones only from the COMMUNITY graph (plan §06). A statement signed
  for the wrong graph does not count.
* LATEST — per threat, the current verdict is the highest sequence, a
  terminal statement (revocation, rejection) winning ties and beating
  replays (:mod:`...kernel.signing.statement_order`).

Pattern: Value Object (:class:`CuratorView`) built by a pure function from
rows the reader fetched.

Usage (from the reader)::

    view = curator_view.build_view(manifest, verified_rows, community_rows,   # manifest: community.trust.manifests
                                   verified_graph=vm_graph, community_graph=community_graph)
    view.is_counted(author_key), view.rejected(identifier), view.revoked
