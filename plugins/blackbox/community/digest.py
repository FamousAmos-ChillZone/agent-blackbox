"""The seen-again counter — a weekly sighting digest per reporter (Refine R2b).

Repeat matches of VERIFIED threats are signal ("thousands of agents met this
site this week"), but a repeat can never be re-shared as a report: the
6-hour cooldown refuses it and the report's name is fixed (KI-170). So repeats
feed a LOCAL weekly tally instead, and once a week ONE signed digest leaves
the machine: the verified threats met during one ISO week, each as a coarse
bucket (1 / 2–9 / 10–99 / 100+). Exact counts and times are a fingerprint of
the user's activity, so none leave (decision 23). Only VERIFIED-tier matches
enter the tally (KI-158): a community-only match would tell whoever listed
the value who met it.

Named by (reporter, ISO week), every week is a NEW asset: no re-share, no
keep-alive, no same-version rejection. The digest for a week is published
once that week is over, so it is complete, and the tally remembers which
weeks it published.

Pattern: :class:`SightingTally` is a small stateful class (one lock, atomic
tmp+rename, bounded to recent weeks); :func:`bucket_for`,
:func:`iso_week`, :func:`build_digest` are pure; publishing is triggered from
the existing sync cycle (:func:`publish_due_digests`), never a new thread.

Usage::

    community.record_verified_sighting("dep:npm:evil@1.0.0")   # from the guard, per match
    community.publish_due_digests(client, cfg)                 # from the refresh cycle
