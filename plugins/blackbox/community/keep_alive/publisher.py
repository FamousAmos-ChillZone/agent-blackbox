"""The keep-alive publish step and the two hooks that feed it (R5).

* :func:`remember_accepted_share` — every share path calls it the moment a
  REPORT is ACCEPTED (the hook share, ``blackbox report``, the retry drain).
  Only reports are kept alive: disputes, retractions and digests are either
  final or period-named and need no copies.
* :func:`forget_retracted` — a retraction ends keep-alive for the identifier.
* :func:`publish_due_copies` — the publish step on the refresh cycle: for every
  live report whose newest copy is from an older epoch, send the same signed
  quads under the epoch's copy name. ACCEPTED is ledgered as ``kept-alive``
  (never as a new contribution); an "already shared" answer means the copy
  exists; the first FAILED answer ends the beat (the node is refusing writes —
  the next refresh tries again, no backoff state needed because the beat is
  periodic and a window is days wide).

The curator never re-shares others' reports: the only way into the store is
this node's own ACCEPTED share, so the publisher can only ever copy what this
node signed. Everything here is fail-open and does nothing while sharing is
off or ``community_keepalive_epoch_days`` is 0.

Usage::

    keep_alive.remember_accepted_share(cfg, name=..., identifier=..., subject=..., severity=..., quads=...)
    keep_alive.forget_retracted(identifier)
    sent = keep_alive.publish_due_copies(client, cfg)      # from the refresh cycle
