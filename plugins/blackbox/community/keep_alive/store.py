"""The live-reports memory — what this node must keep alive on the network (R5).

Shared memory expires per node (30 days by default, measured 2026-10-02), so a
report this node shared would silently vanish from every peer unless someone
re-shares it. Only its AUTHOR may do that (a curator re-share would make the
curator the author, plan §06), so each node remembers every report it got
accepted — name, graph, identifier and the already-signed quads — and the
publisher (:mod:`.publisher`) re-shares each one under an epoch-named asset
while it is still inside its community lifetime.

This is the one piece of state R5 adds beyond the reader's persistence
window: the signed quads must be re-sent byte-for-byte (re-signing would
mint a new statement), and neither the share ledger nor the ruleset holds
them. Pattern: a small persisted store with one lock and atomic writes (the
same shape as :mod:`..share_retry`); bounded to :data:`MAX_LIVE` entries so a
node can never keep more alive than the reader-side per-author cap counts.

Usage::

    store = LiveReportStore()
    store.remember(graph=..., name=..., identifier=..., subject=..., severity=..., quads=..., epoch=...)
    store.due(current_epoch, now)        # LiveReports whose newest copy is from an older epoch
    store.mark_published(name, epoch)
    store.forget_identifier(identifier)  # retracted: never kept alive again
