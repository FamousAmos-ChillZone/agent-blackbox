"""The operator's rights over this node's reporter identity (Refine R1).

Three local verbs of ``blackbox report``. None needs the DKG node, and none
sends anything:

* ``--export PATH`` — a machine-readable JSON copy of this node's statements
  (the share ledger: reports, disputes, retractions and their outcomes) plus
  a BACKUP of the reporter key, so a reinstall does not silently drop a
  counted author. The file holds the private key: it is written owner-only
  (0600), never over an existing file, and the command says so.
* ``--restore-key PATH`` — install the key from such an export (or a bare
  PEM). It refuses to replace a different existing key, which would silently
  change this node's identity.
* ``--erase-identity --confirm`` — destroy the reporter key and the local
  share records. The next report starts a new, unlinked identity. What was
  already shared stays on the network (a shared graph cannot delete it), and
  the command says so; retract first to stop old reports counting.

Usage (from :func:`.report_command.cmd_report`)::

    if report_rights.wants_local_verb(args):
