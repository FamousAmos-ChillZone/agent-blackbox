"""The gates a manual `blackbox report` passes before anything is sent (R13, LES-016).

ONE place for the refusal messages the command prints, so the report path and the
statement path cannot drift. Usage::

    reduction = submission_gate.is_reduction(args)
    refusal = submission_gate.refusal_for(cfg, reduction)
    if refusal is not None:
        return refusal          # the exit code; the reason was printed

Why reductions are special (KI-222): a RETRACTION or DISPUTE reduces what the network
believes about a threat, so it must get through even after the operator switched sharing
off or withdrew consent — otherwise withdrawing consent would trap their own statements.
Reports need a configured graph, sharing on, and a consent record for the current terms.
