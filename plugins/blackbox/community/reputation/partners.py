"""PARTNER organisations: grants, partner reputation, suspension, sponsorship (R4, plan §05).

A partner is an organisation, not a key: all of its keys share ONE cluster
(``"2 PARTNER"`` means two organisations), its weight is 1.0 × the
organisation's reputation so rejections bite, two rejections in 30 days
suspend the grant pending curator review, and every grant is per key and
expires within :data:`GRANT_MAX_DAYS`. An organisation may SPONSOR its own
new nodes: they weigh ≤ 0.5 and share the organisation's strikes.

Pure functions over frozen grants; the ledger holds the outcomes.

Usage::

    grant = PartnerGrant(org="acme", key="…", granted_day="2026-10-02", expires_day="2027-10-02")
    partner_weight(grant, reputation=0.9, rejections_last_30d=1, today="2026-10-10")   # 0.9
    partner_weight(grant, reputation=0.9, rejections_last_30d=2, today="2026-10-10")   # 0.0 (suspended)
