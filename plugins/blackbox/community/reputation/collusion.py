"""Cluster collapse and the collusion DETECTOR (R4, plan §05 COLLUSION).

Two established reporters that are really one actor must count once:
keys that share a transport peer id collapse, and keys whose report sets
over the last :data:`OVERLAP_WINDOW_DAYS` overlap almost entirely (Jaccard ≥
:data:`OVERLAP_JACCARD` over at least :data:`OVERLAP_MIN_SHARED` shared
threats) collapse too — a staggered ring that files the same threats in
turn is one cluster however many wallets it uses. The co-report graph is a
DETECTOR only, never a weight source (at ≤ 50 reporters a ring controls
exactly the links a trust-propagation scheme would mix over).

Pure: ``collapse`` returns the cluster id per key; ``rings`` names groups for
the curator's review. The curator publishes a collapse through the
counted-author list (established keys sharing a cluster carry the same
``org``), so every reader applies it (``community.stages.clusters_for``).

Usage::

    clusters = collapse(reports_by_key, peer_id_by_key={"k1": "12D3…", "k2": "12D3…"})
    rings(reports_by_key)      # [frozenset({...}), ...] groups worth a curator's look
