"""Automated graduation and demotion → counted-author statements (R4).

The reputation machinery never changes a reader directly: a reporter moves
stages only through the curator's 2-of-3 counted-author list. This module
turns a standing into the ``COUNTED_AUTHORS`` payload the curate verbs sign
(``curate propose --nominate``): a graduation lists the key as ESTABLISHED
for twelve months; a demotion delists it (the denylist); a partner grant
lists it as PARTNER under its organisation; a collapse puts established keys
under one shared ``org`` so every reader counts them once.

Usage::

    fields = nomination_fields(standing, address="0x…", today="2026-10-02")   # or None when nothing changes
    verbs.propose_statement(ctx, store, kind=CuratorStatement.COUNTED_AUTHORS,
                            identifier=f"author:{standing.key}", fields=fields)
