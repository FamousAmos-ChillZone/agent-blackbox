"""Beta reputation with forgetting, graduation and demotion rules (R4, plan §05).

Reputation is the mean of a Beta distribution over curator outcomes: each
confirmation adds to α, each rejection to β, and every outcome fades with
age (exponential forgetting, half-life :data:`HALF_LIFE_DAYS`) so an old
record neither protects nor condemns forever. Strikes (confirmed bad faith)
are a separate counter: two demote regardless of reputation, and a demoted
reporter sits out :data:`LOCKOUT_DAYS` and then re-graduates from zero.

Pure functions only; the ledger (:mod:`.ledger`) supplies the outcomes.

Usage::

    rep = beta_reputation([Outcome("2026-09-01", True), Outcome("2026-09-20", False)], today="2026-10-02")
    graduates(standing, today)   # True when 14 days old, ≥5 novel credits, no strikes, not locked out
    demotion(standing, rep)      # a ReporterStanding with a lockout, or None
