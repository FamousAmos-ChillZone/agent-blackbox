"""Signing community statements — proof of who sent a report or dispute (R0b).

Every report and dispute this node shares carries a signed envelope
(:mod:`..kernel.signing`) made with this node's reporter key
(:mod:`..kernel.reporter_key`). The signature is bound to:

* the statement type — ``blackbox.report``, ``blackbox.dispute`` or
  ``blackbox.retract``;
* the environment — the DKG network id the node runs on, so a statement
  signed on a test network can never be replayed on mainnet;
* the community graph it is shared to.

A node that cannot sign does not share (fail closed): an unsigned report would
be indistinguishable from a forged one to every reader (LES-014).

Usage::

    signer = report_signer.resolve_report_signer(client, cfg.community_graph_id)
    if signer is None:
        ...refuse to share...
    quads = build_report_quads(..., signer=signer)
