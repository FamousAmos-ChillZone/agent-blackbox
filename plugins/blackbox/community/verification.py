"""Verifying community reports — the only door from a raw row to a counted report (R0c).

A community row is untrusted: any node can write any ``g:reporter`` string, and
the DKG's own authorship signals are unchecked on some delivery routes
(KI-067/102/110). So a row is believed only when the signed envelope it carries
(:mod:`..kernel.signing`, written by R0b) verifies AND agrees with what the row
shows:

1. the envelope is a ``blackbox.report`` signed for THIS node's network and
   THIS community graph (no replay from a test network or another graph);
2. the row's subject, identifier, reporter and severity equal the signed ones;
3. the subject is the signed reporter's own (``report_uri(identifier, reporter)``);
4. every evidence field the row shows equals the signed value.

Anything else is dropped. A verified report's AUTHOR is the signer's public key
— counting, dedupe and caps key on it, never on the self-described reporter
string, which stays display-only (LES-014). The signer is checked before any
dedupe (KI-144).

Usage::

    verifier = ReportVerifier(environment=network_id, graph=cfg.community_graph_id)
    reports, dropped = verify_report_rows(raw_rows, verifier)
    rules = aggregate_community_reports(reports, prior_first_seen)
