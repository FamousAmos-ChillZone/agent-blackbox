"""The confirmed pool — a VIEW over signed statements (Community Curation C8; plan §05, §08).

A threat is in the confirmed pool while a current confirmation from the
COMMUNITY curators stands for it: enough curator signatures, a signed
reference to the evidence they checked, no later verdict replacing it, and
not past the threat's community lifetime (counted from the confirmation's
signed day). It is a view: nothing new is written to the graph, so every
reader version keeps working.

:func:`confirmed_pool` derives the pool from three things anyone can hold —
the trusted key manifest, curator statement rows and verified reports — and
each :class:`PoolEntry` keeps the SIGNED TEXT of everything it rests on, so it
can be handed to someone who trusts none of us and checked again from the
root key down (:mod:`.bundle`).

Pattern: a pure function returning frozen Value Objects.

Usage::

    entries = confirmed_pool(manifest, statement_rows, verified_reports, graph=community_graph)
    for entry in entries:
        entry.identifier, entry.evidence, entry.trusted_voices, entry.confirmation
