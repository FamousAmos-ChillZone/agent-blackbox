"""The export bundle — the confirmed pool as one file a stranger can check (Community Curation C8, plan §08).

The owner of the verified graph pulls from the confirmed pool without trusting
us. A bundle therefore holds only SIGNED statements that are already public in
the community graph: per threat the curators' confirmation, each reporter's own
report and the curators' listings of those reporters, plus the root-signed key
manifests that make the curator keys trustworthy. What an entry STATES in the
clear (the threat, the evidence reference) is re-derived from its signed
statements by the verifier and must match exactly.

:func:`verify_bundle` needs no node and no network: the file, the community
root key, and the network and graph the receiver expects. A bundle for another
network or graph, or without a manifest that root signed, fails AS A WHOLE; a
damaged entry fails alone, named, with the reason, and the others still pass.

What a bundle cannot prove: that a confirmation was not replaced AFTER the
export (a later rejection is a statement the file does not hold). It proves
what was confirmed, by whom, on what evidence; the live graph or a fresh
export answers "does it still stand".

Format (JSON, :data:`VERSION` 1)::

    {"format": "blackbox.confirmed-pool", "version": 1, "environment": "<network id>", "graph": "<graph id>",
     "manifests": ["<signed key manifest>", ...],
     "entries": [{"identifier": "...", "threat": {"category": "...", "severity": "...", "fields": {...}},
                  "evidence": "advisory:...", "confirmation": "<signed statement>",
                  "reports": ["<signed report>", ...], "listings": ["<signed listing>", ...]}]}

Pattern: Builder (:class:`Bundle` -> text) + a pure verifier returning a tagged result (:class:`BundleReport`).

Usage::

    text = Bundle(environment, graph, manifests, entries).to_text()
    report = verify_bundle(text, {root_key_hex}, environment=network_id, graph=community_graph)
    report.error                      # "" unless the bundle failed as a whole
    [(r.identifier, r.reason) for r in report.entries if not r.ok]
