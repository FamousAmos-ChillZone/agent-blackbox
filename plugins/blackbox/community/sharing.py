    Pattern: Policy object (Strategy) — the entire outbound gate chain lives
    in this single, dependency-injected, testable class instead of scattered
    conditionals. ``decide()`` is pure (no I/O); the one stateful gate (the
    daily cap) is consumed separately by the caller at spawn time so a denied
    decision never burns cap budget.

    Usage::

        policy = CommunitySharePolicy(cfg)
        ok, why = policy.decide(finding_dict, reporter_address)
        if ok and audit.allow_report(cfg.daily_report_limit):
            spawn_community_share(client, cfg, finding_dict, reporter_address)

    Gate order (first refusal wins, ``why`` names it for the debug log):
    ``community off`` → ``no consent`` (R13: the operator must have consented to the
    current reporter terms) → ``excluded source`` → ``vulnerability`` →
    ``community-only match`` → ``no identifier`` → ``no identity`` (KI-003:
    a fallback identity would merge distinct nodes into one ghost reporter —
    refuse instead) → ``not a valid report`` (Refine R1: a finding the report
    schema refuses — e.g. an injection seen in tool-call arguments, which has
    no reportable context — stays local instead of failing at send time).

    Decision 22 (Refine R0, LES-018) — what leaves AUTOMATICALLY is narrowed:

    * vulnerability findings never leave (KI-157): they reveal the reporter's
      unpatched software and add nothing OSV lacks. That covers a
      ``kind=vulnerability`` finding from any tier and an OSV candidate whose
      advisory is not a malicious-package advisory (``MAL-``);
    * a match against a COMMUNITY-only rule never auto-shares (KI-158):
      whoever listed the value would learn who met it. It still flags here and
      can leave only by an explicit operator ``blackbox report``.

    Self-discovered threats and VERIFIED-tier matches still share.
