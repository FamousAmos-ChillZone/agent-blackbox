"""The reader's daily cap on what the community curators can RAISE (Community Curation C3).

The community authority's curator keys sign routine statements on their own,
so they are online keys (KI-258). Two stolen keys must not be able to turn the
whole flag tier on in an afternoon. Every reader therefore admits at most

* ``CONFIRMATIONS_PER_DAY`` new confirmations and stage attestations, and
* ``LISTINGS_PER_DAY`` new counted-author listings

per day of ITS OWN clock, from the community authority. The rest are HELD:
not dropped, just not acted on yet. Held statements are admitted on the
following days, oldest first, so a burst is slowed to the daily rate and a
reader returning from a week offline catches up in a few days — and every
reader reaches the same state in the end.

Safety is asymmetric (LES-016): only statements that raise enforcement are
ever held. Rejections, delistings, deferrals, pauses and notices pass at once,
whatever their number.

The first read of a node is a baseline: everything it finds is admitted (a new
node must not start a hundred statements behind).

Pattern: pure function over verified rows and the stored admissions.

Usage::

    admission = admit(community_rows, stored.admitted, first_read=stored.baseline_until is None, today=today)
    acted_on = [row for row in community_rows if statement_key(row) not in admission.held]
    store.remember(graph, manifests, rows, admitted=admission.admitted)
