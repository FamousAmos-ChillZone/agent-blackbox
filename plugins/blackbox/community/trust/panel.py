"""The trust layer as one read model (Community Curation C10, plan §11 TRACK).

"Who curates, who is trusted, what is confirmed, is anything wrong" — answered
ONCE, from the verified community read, for both surfaces: the dashboard's
trust panel serves it (``dashboard.trust_routes``) and ``blackbox status``
prints it (:func:`status_lines`), so the two can never disagree.

Values are RAW: reporter addresses, organisations and evidence references come
from signed statements but are still other people's text. Each surface
escapes for itself (the dashboard through ``safe_text``, the terminal through
``term_safe``).

Pattern: a read model — a pure function from the read to :class:`TrustPanel`.

Usage::

    panel = trust_panel(read)                 # read: community.CommunityRead
    for line in status_lines(panel): print(line)
