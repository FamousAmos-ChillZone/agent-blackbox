"""Two authorities' views in, the one view readers act on out (Community Curation).

Each authority's statements are verified against its OWN manifest and ordered
in its OWN sequence (``statements.curator_view.build_view``), so a statement
from one authority can never outnumber a statement from the other. This module
is the only place the two meet, and the rule is one line:

    between the two authorities, the MOST RESTRICTIVE current word wins.

* Counted authors — listed by either authority, unless either delisted them.
  When both list a reporter, the verified authority's entry is the one shown.
* Verdict per threat — a terminal verdict (rejection, revocation) from either
  wins; else a deferral still inside its 30 days from either; else a
  confirmation from either; else a notice. The verified authority's record
  wins a tie.
* Stage attestation per threat — the one that enforces less.
* Pause — in force when either authority's pause is.
* ``unavailable`` — when either read failed (readers keep last good).

The result's ``manifest`` and health fields stay the VERIFIED authority's
(the kill list and verified rules depend on them); the community authority's
own view rides along as ``view.community`` for health, the dashboard and the
curators' tooling.

Pattern: pure function over two Value Objects.

Usage::

    view = combine(verified_view, community_view, today="2026-10-03")
    view.is_counted(key); view.verdict(identifier); view.community.manifest
