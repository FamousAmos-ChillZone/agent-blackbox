"""Looking trust statements up in a graph anyone can write (Community Curation C3).

The community graph is open: any node can publish rows beside a curator's,
under the same subject and the same asset name (bench 2026-10-03, KI-250), and
writing is free and fast. A read that SCANS every statement of a type and
orders it can therefore be made slow or truncated by anyone (an ordered scan
costs about 25 times an exact lookup, KI-264). So trust statements are never
scanned:

* statements are fetched by EXACT LOOKUP on identifiers the reader already
  knows — the reporters and threats it holds, plus the fixed ``curator``
  identifier — in batches, with no ordering;
* key manifests are fetched by type without ordering, and by the exact
  subjects the next manifests would have;
* whatever comes back is only a CANDIDATE: the caller verifies every row's
  signatures before it counts (``statements.curator_statements``), so junk
  rows that carry a genuine identifier cost a signature check and nothing else;
* a batch that fails, times out or reaches its row limit makes the lookup
  ``complete = False``: absence then proves nothing, and the reader keeps what
  its own trust store already holds (:mod:`.trust_store`).

Pattern: pure query builders + one function per lookup returning a frozen
:class:`Lookup` (a tagged result).

Usage::

    found = lookup_statements(client, graph, {"curator", "author:<key>", "ioc:ip:203.0.113.7"})
    rows = fold([*stored_rows, *found.rows])      # then verify each row
    if not found.complete: ...absence proves nothing...
