"""Shadow-phase metrics (Refine R15, plan §12) — measured, never guessed.

During the shadow phase the community tier runs on the real network with
stages COMPUTED and LOGGED but only MONITOR enforced. This module is the
log: one :class:`Snapshot` per refresh, appended to
``$BLACKBOX_HOME/shadow_metrics.jsonl`` (bounded), holding the §12 numbers
that a sandbox cannot produce — stage and enforcement distributions (what
WOULD have flagged), delta share (new vs already verified), reporter
diversity, time to CORROBORATED — plus, on the curator node, the newcomer
calibration gap from the private ledger (ORES over-flagged newcomers on 22
of 26 wikis; a gap > 2× triggers a review of the graduation rule).

Pure builders + one append-only file; nothing here changes enforcement.

Usage::

    snapshot = build_snapshot(rs, now)          # from the compiled ruleset
    write_snapshot(snapshot)                     # on the refresh cycle (shadow mode only)
    latest()                                     # the newest Snapshot, or None
    calibration_gap(ledger, today)              # (unlisted rejection rate, counted rejection rate, ratio)
