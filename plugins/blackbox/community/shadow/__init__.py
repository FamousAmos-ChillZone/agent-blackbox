"""Shadow phase (Refine R15): stages computed and logged on the real network, only MONITOR enforced.

With ``community_shadow: true`` the community tier keeps computing every
stage exactly as it would, records the enforcement it WOULD have applied
(``shadowEnforcement``) and then clamps every community rule to MONITOR, so
nothing community-derived reaches a protected agent; each refresh appends a
:class:`Snapshot` of the §12 metrics. The phase exits on measured data
(thresholds tuned from the log, a curator-labelled sample), never on guesses.

Public surface: :func:`clamp_to_monitor` (the tier applies it),
:func:`build_snapshot` / :func:`write_snapshot` / :func:`latest` /
:func:`read_all`, :func:`calibration_gap` (curator node).
