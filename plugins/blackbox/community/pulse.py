"""The community pulse — "did the community graph change?" between full refreshes (R16, KI-202).

Before R16 the community tier was re-read only when the WHOLE ruleset
refreshed: a 15-minute floor on the dashboard, one hour by default. The
near-real-time arrival the benches showed came from a watcher that existed
only in the sandbox. Now one cheap probe — a single aggregate query over the
community graph's shared memory, count plus newest subject — runs at most
every ``cfg.community_poll_interval`` seconds (default 20, 0 = off) while the
agent is active, and only when its answer differs from last time does the
ruleset re-apply the community tier (see ``ruleset.pulse``). Reading stays
the reader's job; this module only says whether there is anything new.

Pattern: one stateful object with one lock (the last fingerprint and the
last probe time), module-level because the state is per process like the
node it talks to.

Usage::

    if community.PULSE.due(interval_s) and community.PULSE.changed(client, cfg): ...re-apply the tier...
