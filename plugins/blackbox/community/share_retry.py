"""Retrying refused community shares — a new node's first reports are not lost (R16, KI-202).

On mainnet a freshly subscribed node is refused for some minutes before its
writes are accepted (``CONTEXT_GRAPH_NOT_FOUND``, then the same write passes
~10 minutes later — measured 2026-10-02). Before R16 a failed share was logged
once and forgotten, so a node's first catches never reached the network.

Now every FAILED share (never an "already shared" one, never a "cannot sign"
one) is queued here with its already-built, already-signed quads and retried
with exponential backoff — 20 s, 40 s, 80 s, then every 2 minutes, at most
:data:`MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts within :data:`GIVE_UP_AFTER_SECONDS` — by the
community pulse (:mod:`.pulse`, every ~20 s while the agent is active) and by
every full ruleset refresh. The queue is persisted, so a share refused in a
short-lived ``blackbox report`` process is retried by the next long-lived one.
Re-sending the same asset name is safe: the node client tolerates an
already-sealed draft and re-shares the sealed assertion.

Pattern: a small persisted queue class with one lock (``ShareRetryQueue``) +
pure scheduling rules; ``retry_due_shares`` is the drain.

Usage::

    share_retry.queue_failed_share(graph=..., name=..., identifier=..., category=..., severity=...,
                                   subject=..., quads=..., error=...)   # from the share paths, on FAILED
    sent = share_retry.retry_due_shares(client, cfg)                    # from the pulse / the refresh
    stats = share_retry.default_queue().stats()                          # for the health line
