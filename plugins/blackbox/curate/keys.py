"""The curator's keys and private working directory (Refine R6).

A curator machine holds ONE curator key (one of the manifest's 2-of-3) at
``$BLACKBOX_HOME/curate/curator_key.pem``. In the SANDBOX a machine may also
hold a root key (``root_key.pem``) to sign key manifests; on a real network the
root is an offline, pre-rotated, custodian-split key (R7b) and never lives in
this directory. Both reuse the reporter key store's one-owner, atomic,
owner-only file discipline — there is one key-file implementation.

Usage::

    store = keys.curator_key_store()          # ReporterKeyStore at the curator path
    key = store.load_or_create()
