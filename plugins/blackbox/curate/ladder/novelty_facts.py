"""Gathering the facts the novelty rule judges (Community Curation C6).

``community.reputation.novelty_credit`` is a pure judge; it needs facts. Until
now a curator had to establish them by hand, so the rule never ran outside its
unit tests (KI-253). This module gathers what the PUBLIC record can establish,
the same way on every curator node:

* ``first_cluster`` — the reporter's report carries the earliest signed day of
  any report of that threat (reports are dated by day, so reporters who share
  the earliest day are all first);
* ``absent_everywhere`` — the threat was not already in the verified tier and,
  for a dependency, the public advisory database does not already list it
  (front-running a feed earns nothing);
* ``corroborated_in_the_wild`` — a counted reporter from ANOTHER cluster also
  reported it;
* ``publisher`` — for a dependency, its ecosystem and package name (the
  closest public stand-in for "the upstream publisher"); at most one novelty
  credit is ever granted per publisher.

What the public record cannot establish is left unknown and judged as such:
the artifact's publication time (the self-dealing window) needs registry
metadata this build does not fetch.

Usage::

                   osv_lookup=osv.lookup, publisher_credits=ledger.publisher_credits)
    reputation.novelty_credit(facts).credit
