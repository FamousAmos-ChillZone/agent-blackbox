"""Crediting reporters from the public record (Community Curation C6).

When the acting authority's verdict on a threat is published — a confirmation
or a rejection — every reporter of that threat is credited with the outcome in
this curator node's PRIVATE ledger, once (``ReputationLedger.record_once``).
A confirmed report that the novelty rule accepts earns the credit that counts
toward graduation.

Nothing here needs the machine that published the verdict: it reads the
community graph's verified reports and the authority's current verdicts, so
ANY curator node can run :func:`credit_verdicts` over the whole record, on
every beat, and reach the same ledger. That is what lets a second curator
check a graduation against its own numbers before co-signing it.

:func:`sync_bands` keeps the ledger's bands in step with the PUBLISHED
trusted-reporter list: a band changes when a listing or delisting is
published, never when it is merely proposed (KI-255).

Strikes are not derivable from the public record (bad faith is a human
judgement) and stay a manual command.

Pattern: Observer on publish + an idempotent sync.

Usage::

    report = outcomes.credit_verdicts(ctx)                # CreditReport(credited=3, novel=1, available=True)
    outcomes.sync_bands(ctx.own_view, ledger, today)
