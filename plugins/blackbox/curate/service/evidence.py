"""What this node establishes BY ITSELF before the service signs (Community Curation C9, plan §07).

The policy (:mod:`.policy`) decides on facts. These are the two facts that
need looking up, and each is this node's own — never what the other curator
or the reporter says:

* :func:`own_check` — this node's lookup of a dependency in the independent
  public advisory source: a malicious-package advisory for that exact
  version, nothing found, or "could not ask" (which is neither).
* :func:`ledger_calls_for` — what this node's own private ledger calls for a
  reporter today: list (a graduation, or the renewal of a listing in good
  standing), delist (the reputation floor or strikes), or nothing.

Pattern: pure functions over injected lookups (the beat passes them in).
