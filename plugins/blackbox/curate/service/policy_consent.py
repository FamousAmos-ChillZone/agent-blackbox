"""Standing consent to the automation policy, bound to its exact text (Community Curation C9, plan §07).

Every outward curator write is a legal act under the curator's key, so the
service signs on its own only after the operator has read and accepted the
automation policy. The acceptance names the policy's hash: when the policy
text changes — a new automatic action, another limit — the stored acceptance
no longer matches and the service stops signing until the operator accepts
the new text. Withdrawing is one command and takes effect on the next beat.

State: ``$BLACKBOX_HOME/curate/policy_consent.json`` — one class owns the
file, one lock, atomic writes. Local only; never shared.

Usage::

    consent = PolicyConsent()
    consent.accept(policy.policy_text(), key_hex=my_key, day="2026-10-03")
    consent.accepted(policy.policy_text())      # False after any change to the text, or a withdrawal
