"""The automation policy — what the curator service may sign on its own (Community Curation C9, plan §07).

One pure decision table. For an action and the facts THIS node established by
itself, :func:`decide` answers either "the service may sign" or "a person
must", with the reason. Nothing here reads the network: the beat gathers the
facts (:mod:`.beat`) and asks.

The table, in words (:data:`POLICY_ROWS` is the same table as data, and
:func:`policy_text` is the exact text an operator accepts):

* no judgement involved — heartbeat, in-review acknowledgement, keep-alive;
* a lookup in an independent public source — confirm a dependency when this
  node itself finds a malicious-package advisory for that exact version, and
  the statement cites that advisory;
* a clock — defer a corroborated blockable threat this node's own lookup found
  nothing for; lapse a deferral after 30 days;
* arithmetic over the public record — list a reporter, renew a listing or
  delist on the reputation floor when this node's own ledger calls for it;
* everything else is a person's: confirming anything else, rejecting, a
  strike, a partner grant, a pause, a collapse, anything with the root key.

Pattern: Strategy table (one rule per action) returning a frozen Value Object.

Usage::

    decision = decide(action_for(kind, fields), identifier, Facts(malicious_advisory="MAL-2026-1",
                                                                  evidence_cited="advisory:MAL-2026-1"))
