"""One beat of the curator service (Community Curation C9, plan §07).

A curator node runs ONE service. Every few minutes it performs the same steps
in the same order:

1. heartbeat — "this key is alive";
2. read — the proposals the other curators sent;
3. co-sign — for each proposal the policy allows, check it AGAIN on this
   node, co-sign and publish; everything else waits for a person;
4. first signatures — for each new threat in the queue: confirm a dependency
   this node itself found a malicious-package advisory for (sign, send to the
   other curators), defer or lapse by the clock, acknowledge the rest;
5. credit — record the outcome of every published verdict in the private ledger;
6. ladder — propose the listings, renewals and delistings the ledger calls for;
7. keep alive — re-publish this node's current statements before shared memory forgets them.

Nothing is signed unless this machine's key is a curator key of the trusted
manifest AND its operator accepted the automation policy as it reads today
(:mod:`.policy_consent`). Without that the beat still reads, credits and
lists what waits for a person. Two nodes reach the same answer separately:
the first signs after its own check, the second signs only after ITS own
check; a proposal the second node cannot reproduce is not co-signed.

A step that fails is recorded and the others still run. Nothing is left
half-done: a statement that was signed but could not be published stays
APPROVED and the next beat publishes it; a proposal that could not be sent is
sent again.

Pattern: Template Method — :meth:`Beat.run` is the fixed order; each step is
one small method that records what it did in the beat's :class:`.report.Run`.

Usage::

    beat = Beat(lambda interest: build_context(compiled_ruleset, interest=interest), peers=["curator-b", "curator-c"])
    report = beat.run()
    print(report.summary())
