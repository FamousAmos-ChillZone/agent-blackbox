"""What this curator node published in the community graph and must keep alive.

Every reader keeps its own verified copy of the trust statements it has seen
(``community.trust.trust_store``), but a node that joins later only sees what
is on the network NOW — and shared memory forgets after about 30 days. So the
machine that published a statement re-publishes it once per keep-alive epoch
(10 days by default: a third of the memory) under a new asset name with the
same signed content; readers fold the copies to one.

Only CURRENT statements are kept alive: publishing a newer statement in the
same slot — a delisting after a listing, a rejection after a confirmation, a
new manifest — ends keep-alive for the older one, and a listing past its
expiry or a pause past its end is retired. Heartbeats are never kept alive
(a fresh one is published every day).

The store reuses the report keep-alive store (one implementation of the
"what must I re-publish" file); only its path differs:
``$BLACKBOX_HOME/curate/published_statements.json``.

Usage::

    published.remember(cfg, graph=graph, name=asset_name, quads=quads)        # after a publish that was read back
    sent = published.publish_due(client, cfg)                                 # from the curator's beat
    published.forget_identifier("author:<reporter key>")                      # a reporter asked to be erased
