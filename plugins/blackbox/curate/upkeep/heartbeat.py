"""The curator heartbeat — "this key is alive" (Community Curation C5).

Readers tell a silent curator from an absent one by heartbeats: a key that has
not beaten for 48 hours raises an alarm, and when NO key of an authority has
beaten for 7 days its root alone may sign reductions. Before this module
nothing ever published a heartbeat, so the first could never be told from the
second (KI-247).

A heartbeat is one statement signed by ONE curator key, naming that key; it
lives in the community graph and is not kept alive (a fresh one is published
every day).

Usage::

    proposal, outcome = heartbeat.publish_heartbeat(ctx, ProposalStore(), yes=True)
