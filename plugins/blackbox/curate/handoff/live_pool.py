"""The confirmed pool as THIS node sees it, ready to hand on (Community Curation C8).

``community.pool`` is pure; this module feeds it from the live node: the
verified reports and the curators' statements this node holds, with the same
restrictions every reader applies — a threat the verified authority rejected
or revoked is not in the pool (the most restrictive word wins), a threat that
is already in the verified graph has nothing left to hand over, and a
confirmation this reader is still holding back under its daily cap is not
acted on yet.

Pattern: a function returning a tagged result (:class:`LivePool`).

Usage::

    pool = read_live_pool(ctx)
    if pool.unavailable: ...say why...
    text = bundle_text(ctx, pool)                  # the export file
