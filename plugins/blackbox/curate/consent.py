"""Consent for outward curator writes, made mechanical (Refine R6, plan §09).

Every write to a shared graph is a legal act under the curator's key, so it
needs consent BOUND TO ITS CONTENT: the CLI shows what will be published and
the operator types the first 8 hex characters of the content hash. A ``--yes``
flag is accepted only in the SANDBOX (no pinned curator root for the network);
on a network with a pinned root it is refused. A shown code is single-use and
expires 10 minutes after it was shown; when the write it allowed did not
succeed the consent is RELEASED, so the same content can be consented to again
(KI-249: a failed write must not leave the operator unable to retry). Every decision lands in an append-only
local ledger — never shared (plan §11: the consent ledger is local only).

The hardware-key touch ("the key-B touch IS the consent") arrives with the
pilot gate (R7b): this module is the typed half.

Usage::

    ledger = ConsentLedger()
    code = ledger.show(envelope_text, summary)        # print the summary + code to the operator
    ok, why = ledger.consent(envelope_text, typed=code_from_operator, sandbox=is_sandbox, yes=False)
