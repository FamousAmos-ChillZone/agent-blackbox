"""The community pulse keeps beating while the dashboard runs, browser or not (KI-283).

The pulse is the cheap beat between full refreshes: it keeps the node's
community membership alive (the link to the graph's owner, KI-297; a missing
graph definition, KI-295) and pulls new community statements into the rules
within ~20 s. It used to run only when an agent acted (``ruleset.get``) or a
browser polled ``/api/health`` — so an idle node with no dashboard tab open
never redialled the owner and saw community reports only at the hourly
refresh (bench v21-b, 2026-10-06). The dashboard is the node's long-lived
process, so it drives the beat itself.

Pattern: a small Active Object — one daemon thread owned by :class:`PulseDriver`,
started and stopped by the dashboard's lifecycle hooks. ``ruleset.pulse`` is
already self-limiting (it beats only when due and never blocks), so the loop
just offers it a chance every ``community_poll_interval`` seconds.

Usage::

    driver = PulseDriver(beat=beat_once, interval=poll_interval)
    driver.start()      # on dashboard startup
    driver.stop()       # on shutdown
