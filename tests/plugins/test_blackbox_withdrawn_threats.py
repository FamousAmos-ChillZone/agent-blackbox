"""KI-275 — a threat that was rejected, revoked or retracted is never kept on a reader.

Readers keep a counted threat whose network copies expired for up to 90 days
(R5), and keep their last good tier through an empty read they do not believe
yet (KI-262) or a pause. A rejection or a retraction also makes a threat
vanish from the read — on purpose. Before this fix both safety nets brought
the threat back at its old FLAG, so a curator rejection did not reach the hot
path for up to 90 days. Reductions always get through (LES-016).
