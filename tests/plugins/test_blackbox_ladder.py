"""Community Curation C6 — the reporter ladder runs itself.

A curator's published verdict credits the reporters it concerns in the
curator's PRIVATE ledger, once, with no command typed; the novelty rule runs on
facts gathered from the public record; any curator node rebuilds the same
ledger from that record; and a band moves when a listing is published, never
when it is proposed.

Reporters, three curator machines and the shared network come from the
multi-machine harness; every report is built by the product's own writer.
