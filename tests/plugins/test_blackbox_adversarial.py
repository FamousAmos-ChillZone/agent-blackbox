"""Refine R11 — the sandbox adversarial suite and the ACCEPTANCE STATEMENT.

Every attack script from the plan (§05 anti-gaming, §06 anti-pollution and
asymmetric safety, §07 hardening) runs here as a table-driven test over the
REAL Phase 1 pipeline — nothing below the node is stubbed:

    signed rows built by the real writer  →  one fake node (both graphs)
    →  the one community reader (signatures, statements, budgets)
    →  aggregation  →  stages  →  the compiled community tier
    →  queue admission / health items / the dashboard's display seam

The acceptance statement is DATA (:data:`CAN`, :data:`CANNOT`): every CAN
claim names the test that proves it, and :func:`test_the_acceptance_statement_is_checked_item_by_item`
fails if a named test does not exist — so the statement cannot drift from the
suite. CANNOT lists what no sandbox can prove; those are measured in the
shadow phase (R15), never claimed here.
