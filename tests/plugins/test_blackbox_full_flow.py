"""Community Curation C12 — the whole flow, as several machines, on every run of the suite.

Plan section 14, layer 2. One shared in-memory network (``_machines``) holds:
reporter nodes (F, and a second partner P), three community curators (A, B, C)
each running the curator service with its OWN advisory lookup, a plain reader
(R) and a receiver (U) that holds nothing but the community root key. Every
step's effect is observed on a machine other than the one that acted.

    root signs the manifest ............. R trusts the three curator keys
    F and P are granted PARTNER (2 keys)  their reports count on R
    F reports a package and an address .. both FLAG on R
    A and B each find the advisory ...... the package is CONFIRMED on R, no command typed
    the confirmation credits F .......... in B's private ledger
    B exports the pool .................. U verifies it offline and sees it in its dossier
    P disputes the address .............. the address decays to MONITOR on R
    F retracts the address .............. F's voice is withdrawn on R
    two curators reject the package ..... REJECTED on R, and it leaves the pool
    two curators delist F ............... F's next report only MONITORs on R
    two curators pause intake ........... R keeps its last good tier, paused
    the curators fall silent ............ R's operator sees it, flags in force stay
    an address outlives its lifetime .... EXPIRED on R
