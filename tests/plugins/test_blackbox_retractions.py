"""Refine R1 — a reporter can withdraw its own report (`blackbox report --retract`).

A retraction counts only when signed by the SAME key that signed the report:
it withdraws that signer's voice and nobody else's (LES-014). Readers always
honour it (LES-016: statements that reduce enforcement must get through), and
a retraction read that fails makes the whole read unavailable instead of
re-counting withdrawn reports.
